# Final Year Project

## Intoduction
The game that I am currently working is called **"Unblock Me"** which has a very similar gameplay as a boardgame called [**"Rush Hour"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)). The game is powered by a python library called [**"Pygame"**](https://www.pygame.org/news), Pygame 2.6.0, which can by installed by the code below.
```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pygame==2.6.0
```
Also I will be documenting my own work by writing a diary, which can be found in `./Assets/diary.md`

## Basic Usage of this project

Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements`.

Running the game simply using the command `python ./PROJECT/Game/main.py`
