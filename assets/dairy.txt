- Created the basic files for the rush_hour game.
- Implementation of the basic code for the pygame to run.
- Implementation of the basic code for the game to work in console first.

-Created the basic functions like grid rendering, and winning message for the game.
-Tested if the red block passed the exit and will it appear the winning message and update the game state act as a soft lock.

-Created the function of the block.py, which contain drag function, their data position/orientation/colour/size and how they are being rendered
-I figured that due to my function making the block can only move within 6x6 grid. And i needed my red block to move past the array [5][2] as right now when the red block moved to [5][2] it counts as victorious.
we doesnt want that to happened, so I recreated the array, making the red block accessible to [6][2] and fixed some code to expand the grid beyond 6x6, making it look more appealing.

-I thought of a way to make the game more interesting by adding multiple levels. It will also give the game a "Gameboy-like" appearance.
